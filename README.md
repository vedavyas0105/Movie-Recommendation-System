# Movie-Recommendation-System
This Jupyter Notebook implements a content-based movie recommendation system using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. It preprocesses movie data, converts textual features into numerical vectors, and suggests similar movies based on user input while handling typos with the difflib library.
